# Sales-App
This is a full stack application which is built using **MERN** stack. This includes User registartion, user login, authentication, Adding sales, Checking the top 5 sales and total revenue generated.
To access the application, the user should be logged in or it shows an error that user should be logged in. That means to add sales or check total revenue or to check top 5 sales, the user should be logged in. For authentication/authorization, I used **Json Web Tokens (JWT)**. Also used Sweetalerts to show the alert messages.


Below is the interface of the sales app
